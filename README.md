# Digit Recognizer Application

This project is a **real-time digit recognition application** built using Python. Users can draw digits on a canvas, and the app will predict the digit in real-time using a pre-trained machine learning model.

## Features

- **Real-Time Predictions**: Draw digits on a canvas, and the app will predict the digit and display the confidence score.
- **Pre-trained Model**: Uses a TensorFlow model to classify digits drawn by the user.
