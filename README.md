# Digit Recognizer Application

This project is a **real-time digit recognition application** built using Python. Users can draw digits on a canvas, and the app will predict the digit in real-time using a pre-trained machine learning model. The app is packaged into a standalone executable, available for download in the **Releases** section.

## Features

- **Real-Time Predictions**: Draw digits on a canvas, and the app will predict the digit and display the confidence score.
- **Clear Interface**: The user interface includes a "Clear" button to reset the canvas and start over.
- **Pre-trained Model**: Uses a TensorFlow model to classify digits drawn by the user.
- **Standalone Executable**: Download and run the app without needing Python installed on your system.

## Download the Executable

You can download the **pre-built executable** from the [Releases](https://github.com/your-username/digit-recognizer-app/releases) section of this repository.

- **Windows Users**: Download `digit_recognizer_app.exe` from the latest release and run it on your system.
